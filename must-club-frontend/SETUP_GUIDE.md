# 🚀 Quick Setup Guide for React Beginners

This guide will help you set up and run the MUST Science Innovators Club frontend application, even if you're new to React!

## 📋 What You Need

Before starting, make sure you have:
- A computer with internet connection
- About 30 minutes of time
- Willingness to learn! 😊

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Install Node.js
Node.js is required to run React applications.

1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the **LTS version** (recommended for most users)
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions
4. Restart your computer after installation

**Verify Installation:**
Open your terminal/command prompt and type:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```
You should see version numbers for both.

### Step 2: Get the Project Files
You should already have the project files in `/workspace/must-club-frontend/`. If not, ask your instructor for the project files.

### Step 3: Open Terminal in Project Directory
1. **Windows**: Open Command Prompt or PowerShell, navigate to the project folder
2. **Mac/Linux**: Open Terminal, navigate to the project folder

```bash
cd /path/to/must-club-frontend
```

### Step 4: Install Project Dependencies
This downloads all the libraries the project needs:

```bash
npm install
```

This might take 2-5 minutes. You'll see lots of text scrolling - that's normal!

### Step 5: Set Up Environment
Copy the example environment file:

```bash
# On Windows
copy .env.example .env

# On Mac/Linux
cp .env.example .env
```

### Step 6: Start the Application
```bash
npm start
```

After 30-60 seconds, your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:3000` showing the application!

2. Copy the structure from an existing page
3. Add your content
4. Add the route in `src/App.tsx`

### Changing Styles:
- We use **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- Add classes like `bg-blue-500`, `text-white`, `p-4` to elements
- Check [Tailwind CSS docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for all available classes

### Adding New Features:
1. Create components in `src/components/`
2. Use them in your pages
3. Connect to the API using `src/services/api.ts`

## 🚨 Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem: "Module not found" errors
**Solution:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

### Problem: "Port 3000 is already in use"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill the process using port 3000
npx kill-port 3000
# Then start again
npm start
```

### Problem: Can't connect to backend API
**Solution:**
1. Make sure your Django backend is running on port 8000
2. Check the `REACT_APP_API_URL` in your `.env` file
3. It should be `http://localhost:8000`

### Problem: Changes don't appear
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you saved the file
2. Check the terminal for any error messages
3. Try refreshing the browser (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
